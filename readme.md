# Whatever Conf!

On thursday and friday of the coming week(28 May and 29 May), we'll be having Whatever Conf at General Assembly. This is an opportunity for you as students to teach everyone else a little bit about something.

## Objectives for Whatever Conf
- Get practice getting up in front of people and talking about something, anything!
- To do research on something and give a presentation to a class
- Learn something new or dive deeper into something your passionate about
- Articulate to someone on a topic so the audience can walk away with a clear understanding of what you are trying to teach/explain/inform/entertain

## Description of Talk
- Be creative! This is your chance to show/present to everyone something awesome! It doesn't have to be about code, but it can be.
- Presentations will be given on thursday and friday. There will be signup sheets posted monday on a "first come, first serve" basis.
- Plan on presenting for 12 minutes /w 3 minute Q & A to follow

## Why are we doing this? How will this make us better at coding?
- At General Assembly, we're not trying to teach you how to just code. The idea is to make you a well rounded web developer. With that entails many things:
  - the ability to articulate something well to others, whether it's code or otherwise
  - the ability to research a point of interest and figure out what's important
  -

## Weekend Homework
- Create a repo for your presentation which will contain everything file based you will use barring external props(which are encouraged!)
- In the repo have at the least a `readme.md` with learning objectives for your presentation
