# Whatever Conf!

On thursday and friday of the coming week(28 May and 29 May), we'll be having Whatever Conf at General Assembly. This is an opportunity for you as students to teach everyone else a little bit about something.

## Objectives for Whatever Conf
- Get practice getting up in front of people and talking about something, anything!
- To do research on something and give a presentation to a class
- Learn something new or dive deeper into something youâ€™re passionate about
- Articulate to someone on a topic so the audience can walk away with a clear understanding of what you are trying to teach/explain/inform/entertain

## Description of Talk
- Be creative! This is your chance to show/present to everyone something awesome! It doesn't have to be about code, but it can be.
- Presentations will be given on Thursday and Friday. There will be signup sheets posted Monday on a "first come, first serve" basis.
- Plan on presenting for 12 minutes /w 3 minute Q & A to follow

## Why are we doing this? How will this make us better at coding?
- At General Assembly, we're not trying to teach you how to just code. The idea is to make you a well rounded web developer. With that entails many things:
  - the ability to articulate something well to others, whether it's code or otherwise
  - the ability to research a point of interest and figure out what's important
  - thus far we've only presented in groups or science fair style. Ideally we want to place you in a "pseudo" nerve racking situation in a safe environment while here at GA. Which ultimately will help you speak solitarily in front of others in various other "high pressure" situations.

## Weekend Homework
- Create a repo for your presentation which will contain everything file based you will use barring external props(which are encouraged!)
- In the repo have a `readme.md` with at least 3 learning objectives for your presentation

## Additional Homework
Think about what you want to do for your final project. You will be asked to submit a project idea on monday.
