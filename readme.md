# Everything Conf!

On Thursday and Friday of the coming week (28 May and 29 May), we'll be having Evertyhing Conf at General Assembly. This is an opportunity for you as students to teach everyone else a little bit about something.

## Objectives

- Learn something new or dive deeper into something you're passionate about.
- Practice talking to an audience about something that interests you!
- Research something and give a presentation on what you've learned.

## Requirements

- Be creative! This is your chance to present something awesome! It doesn't have to be about code, but it can be.
- Presentations will be given on Thursday and Friday. There will be signup sheets posted Monday. Sign up for a time slot on a "first come, first serve" basis.
- Plan on presenting for **no more** than 12 minutes /w three minute Q&A to follow.
- Have fun!

## Why are we doing this? How will this make us better at coding?

Being a developer isn't just about programming. Successful developers are well-rounded; they can code, research, and communicate. What does this mean for your professional development? You should cultivate:

  - the ability to articulate something well to others, whether it's code or otherwise.
  - the ability to research a point of interest and figure out key points for an audience.
  - the ability to tell a story to a larger audience in a formal setting, just like a meetup or professional conference.

Students have sometimes been asked to present on a topic they were passionate about as part of a job interview. Conference speakers command higher salaries, partly because it looks good on a resum√©, but also because they network and others recognize their names.

## Weekend Homework
1. Create a repo for your presentation which will contain all digital presentation artifacts (notes, presentations, outlines, links to resources, etc. Real, physical props and bad jokes are encouraged, but it's hard to commit bicycles, skateboards, and finger guns to git.
1. The repo must contain a `readme.md` with at least three learning objectives for your presentation.
1. Open an issue to **this** repo with a link to **your** repo.

## Additional Homework
Think about what you want to do for your final project. You will be asked to submit a project idea on Tuesday.
