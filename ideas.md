# Random ideas for EveryConf:

- Have it be a part of the Project 4 grade
- Tell everyone the GA staff will be invited to attend
- Ask everyone to do a 5-minute voice and/or video recording of their presentation tonight
- Have the audience write down feedback for each speaker
- Tell them that if someone is clearly unprepared, we'll boo them off the stage
- Tell everyone we'll be recording each presentation ourselves and put them on YouTube
- See if there are any potential employers we can scramble to attend
- Open the presentations up to 1776
